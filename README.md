# Color-Wheel
4 inch, 12 color Color Wheel for photography
This wheel was made with a laser cutter, but you may be able to use a vinyl cutter with certain materials.
It is made with an adapter to fit a small microwave motor, but this can be omitted.
You will need 12 cuts of the Gel Cutout.
The 12 Gel pieces should fit around the Ring in the Vinyl Overlay file.
Once the Gels are installed on the Ring, apply the Ring to the 4 inch Vinyl circle.
Then, apply the Vinyl to the Transparent Acrylic Disk
The Center Cap was cut with Black Vinyl for a clean middle.
